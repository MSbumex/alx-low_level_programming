Project : 0x0A. C - argc, argv
int main(int argc, char *argv[]);
There are at least two arguments to main: argc and argv.
 The first of these is a count of the arguments supplied to the program and 
the second is an array of pointers to the strings which are those arguments—its type is (almost) 
‘array of pointer to char’. These arguments are passed to the program by the host system's 
command line interpreter or job control language.
