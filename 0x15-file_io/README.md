files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
 files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
 not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
Allowed syscalls: read, write, open, close
You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
Tip: always prefer using symbolic constants (POSIX) vs numbers when it makes sense. For instance read(STDIN_FILENO, ... vs read(0, ...
